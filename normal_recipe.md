For a delightful Korean dinner that serves three people, we can prepare Bulgogi (Korean BBQ Beef) with a side of Kimchi and Steamed Rice. This meal is flavorful, satisfying, and relatively easy to prepare at home.

**Ingredients:**

*For the Bulgogi:*
- 1 pound (450g) beef ribeye or sirloin, thinly sliced
- 1/4 cup soy sauce
- 2 tablespoons sugar
- 1 tablespoon sesame oil
- 1 tablespoon rice wine (mirin)
- 1 tablespoon minced garlic
- 1 tablespoon grated ginger
- 2 green onions, chopped
- 1/4 teaspoon black pepper
- 1 medium onion, thinly sliced
- 1 carrot, julienned
- 1 tablespoon sesame seeds

*For the Kimchi:*
- 1/2 medium napa cabbage, chopped
- 1/4 cup Korean chili flakes (gochugaru)
- 2 tablespoons fish sauce
- 2 tablespoons minced garlic
- 1 tablespoon grated ginger
- 1 tablespoon sugar
- 3 green onions, chopped

*For the Steamed Rice:*
- 1 1/2 cups short-grain white rice
- 2 cups water

**Preparation Instructions:**

1. **Prepare the Bulgogi Marinade:**
   - In a large bowl, combine soy sauce, sugar, sesame oil, rice wine, minced garlic, grated ginger, chopped green onions, and black pepper. Mix well until the sugar is dissolved.

2. **Marinate the Beef:**
   - Add the thinly sliced beef to the marinade, ensuring each piece is well-coated. Cover and let it marinate in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes, or up to 2 hours for more flavor.

3. **Cook the Bulgogi:**
   - Heat a large skillet or grill pan over medium-high heat. Add the marinated beef slices along with the onion and carrot. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the beef is browned and cooked through, about 5-7 minutes. Sprinkle with sesame seeds before serving.

4. **Prepare the Kimchi:**
   - In a large bowl, combine chopped napa cabbage with Korean chili flakes, fish sauce, minced garlic, grated ginger, sugar, and green onions. Mix thoroughly, ensuring the cabbage is well-coated with the seasoning. Let it sit for at least 30 minutes before serving to allow the flavors to meld.

5. **Cook the Steamed Rice:**
   - Rinse the rice under cold water until the water runs clear. Combine the rice and water in a pot and let it soak for 30 minutes. Bring to a boil over medium heat, then reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer for 15 minutes. Remove from heat and let it rest, covered, for another 10 minutes before fluffing with a fork.

**Serving Suggestions:**

- Serve the Bulgogi hot, garnished with additional sesame seeds and chopped green onions if desired. Pair it with a side of freshly prepared Kimchi and a portion of steamed rice on each plate.
- For an authentic touch, consider providing lettuce leaves for wrapping the Bulgogi, along with a small dish of ssamjang (a Korean dipping sauce) for added flavor.
- Complement the meal with a refreshing Korean beverage like barley tea or a light beer.

This combination of Bulgogi, Kimchi, and Steamed Rice provides a balanced and flavorful Korean dining experience that is sure to delight your guests. Enjoy your meal!
