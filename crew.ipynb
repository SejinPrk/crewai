      "\n",
      "**Preparation Instructions:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Prepare the Bulgogi Marinade:**\n",
      "   - In a large bowl, combine soy sauce, sugar, sesame oil, rice wine, minced garlic, grated ginger, chopped green onions, and black pepper. Mix well until the sugar is dissolved.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Marinate the Beef:**\n",
      "   - Add the thinly sliced beef to the marinade, ensuring each piece is well-coated. Cover and let it marinate in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes, or up to 2 hours for more flavor.\n",
      "\n",
